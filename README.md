This document serves as an optional checklist for authors submitting manuscripts to, and reviewers evaluating manuscripts for, the ACM Transactions on Recommender Systems (ACM TORS). The checklist aims to clarify important aspects of offline evaluation in recommender systems, as valued by ACM TORS. Please
note that this is the first version of the checklist, and the editors-in-chief highly welcome any feedback. Reviewers are encouraged, but not required, to refer to this document and incorporate the mentioned points in their reviews. Authors are similarly encouraged, but not required, to consult this checklist prior to conducting their
research. Authors may choose to complete the checklist and include it as an appendix in their manuscript to facilitate the review process. 

This checklist is published under the CC-BY 4 license1, and based on the Dagstuhl Seminar 24211 checklist as proposed in 2024 by Beel, Jannach, Said, Shani, Vente and Wegmeth.
